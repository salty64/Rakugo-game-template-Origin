## What do you need to know

### Project Settings

In your Project Settings, enable "Advanced Settings". In Application/Addons/RakugoGameTemplate you can set some values.

* **Loading Scene Path** is the path to the Loading Scene of your project. It is used by the SceneLoader when you change scene
* **Main Menu Path** is the path to the Main Menu scene of your project. It is used when you return to the Main Menu from the Pause Menu
* **First Game Scene Path** is the path to the First Game Scene of your project. It is used when you click on the play button in the Main Menu

### Autoloads

When you enabled the plugin it will add some autoloads

* **SceneLoader** you can use it to load scene with the method *change_scene*(path_tscn:String, wait_after_load:bool = true). It will pause the tree, make a transition to the Loading Scene, before the end of the transition the tree is unpaused, then it load the wanted scene, after wait or not an action from the player, pause the tree again, a last transition to the desired scene and at the end after the transition is finished, unpause the tree.

```gd
const level_12 = "res://scenes/levels/level_12.tscn"
...
SceneLoader.change_scene(level_12)
```

* **Transitions** you can use it to make a transition with the method *transition*(transition_type, reverse:bool). transition_type are {Swipe,Square,Circle,Diamond,Line}. Transitions always works instead the tree is paused. It will not pause the tree for you, you should handle it.

```gd
get_tree().paused = true
Transitions.transition(Transitions.transition_type.Square)
await Transitions.animation_player.finished
get_tree().pause = false
```
